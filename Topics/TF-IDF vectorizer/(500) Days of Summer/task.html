  <p>Tom wants to know whether the word <code class="language-python">Summer</code> is important for the collection of texts and what kind of context surrounds this term. As you know, <code class="language-python">summer</code> can be both a proper (denotes a specific person, place, etc.: Jack, London, Newton's first law) and a common name (denotes any object: woman, chair, cat).</p> 
  <p>Correct the code below so that the vectorizer could be case-sensitive and could extract bigrams (two-word phrases) and trigrams (three-word phrases). Put the final version of this vectorizer in the answer box. <strong>Do not remove any parameters</strong>, just copy the code below and correct their values where needed.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(input='content', use_idf=True, lowercase=True,
                             analyzer='word', ngram_range=(1, 1),
                             stop_words=None)</code></pre>
